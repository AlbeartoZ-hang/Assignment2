# Assignment 2

## Objectives

To gain a solid understanding of Operators, System Input/Output, Conditional Statements, and Relational and Boolean Operators.

### Part 1

1.  Write a program `evenodd.c` to check if a user-input number is even or odd. You can assume the user enters an integer.
2.  Write a program `threenums.c` that takes in 3 user-input numbers and prints “numbers are equal” if all 3 numbers are equal, and “not equal”, followed by the largest number, if the numbers are not equal.  Then print out the sum of the 3 numbers.
  
### Part 2

1.  What is the outcome of the following conditional statements if the value of variable x is 5?  Show your work.

    a.  ``` x <= 4 || (x != 9  && x > 10) ```
    
    b.  ``` x > 0 && x < 10 && x != 6 ```
    
    c.  ``` x == 1 || x > 0 ```

2.  Can we use string value/variable in switch test condition? Why or why not? 

3.  What is wrong with the following code snippet?  As written, what will it do?
```
			int userIn;
			scanf(“%d”, userIn);
```
